# Product Context: Claudesidian MCP

## Why This Plugin Exists

Claudesidian MCP was created to bridge the gap between AI assistants and personal knowledge management systems. While AI assistants like Claude are powerful tools for generating content and answering questions, they lack direct access to a user's personal knowledge base. Similarly, knowledge management systems like Obsidian excel at storing and organizing information but lack the intelligence to understand and manipulate that information in natural ways.

This plugin solves this fundamental disconnect by implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI assistants to:

1. Access and understand the user's knowledge base
2. Create, modify, and organize notes based on natural language instructions
3. Search and retrieve relevant information from the vault
4. Assist with knowledge management tasks in a conversational manner

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Knowledge Accessibility

**Problem**: Users have valuable knowledge stored in their Obsidian vaults, but AI assistants can't access this information.

**Solution**: Claudesidian MCP exposes vault content as MCP resources, allowing AI assistants to read and understand the user's notes, providing context-aware assistance.

### 2. Knowledge Capture

**Problem**: Capturing and organizing knowledge requires manual effort and discipline.

**Solution**: The plugin enables AI assistants to create and organize notes based on conversations, reducing friction in the knowledge capture process.

### 3. Knowledge Retrieval

**Problem**: Finding specific information in large knowledge bases can be challenging and time-consuming.

**Solution**: AI assistants can search and query the vault using natural language, retrieving relevant information quickly and presenting it in a useful format.

### 4. Knowledge Organization

**Problem**: Maintaining a well-organized knowledge base requires consistent effort and clear organizational principles.

**Solution**: AI assistants can help organize notes, suggest connections, and maintain consistency in the knowledge structure.

### 5. Integration Complexity

**Problem**: Integrating AI capabilities with knowledge management systems typically requires complex setups or third-party services.

**Solution**: Claudesidian MCP provides a simple, local integration between Obsidian and AI assistants like Claude Desktop.

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

1. **Seamless Integration**: The plugin should integrate naturally with both Obsidian and Claude Desktop, requiring minimal configuration.

2. **Natural Interaction**: Users should be able to interact with their vault through natural language conversations with the AI assistant.

3. **Contextual Awareness**: The AI assistant should understand the structure and content of the vault, providing relevant suggestions and actions.

4. **Privacy-Preserving**: All operations should happen locally, with user data remaining within their control.

5. **Transparent Operation**: Users should understand what the AI assistant can access and what actions it can perform.

### Core Workflows

#### 1. Knowledge Retrieval

```
User: "What notes do I have about project management?"
Claude: [Searches vault]
Claude: "I found several notes about project management:
1. 'Agile Project Management Basics' (Last modified: March 2)
2. 'Project Planning Template' (Last modified: February 15)
3. 'Meeting Notes: Project Kickoff' (Last modified: March 5)
Would you like me to summarize any of these?"
```

#### 2. Knowledge Capture

```
User: "Create a note about the book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow'"
Claude: [Creates note]
Claude: "I've created a note titled 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' in your vault. Would you like me to add some basic information about the book, such as the author and key concepts?"
```

#### 3. Knowledge Organization

```
User: "Help me organize my project notes"
Claude: [Analyzes vault]
Claude: "I notice you have 15 project-related notes scattered across different folders. Would you like me to suggest a folder structure to organize them better? I could create categories like 'Active Projects', 'Completed Projects', and 'Project Resources'."
```

#### 4. Knowledge Enhancement

```
User: "Enhance my note on machine learning algorithms"
Claude: [Reads note]
Claude: "I've reviewed your note on machine learning algorithms. I notice it covers supervised learning well, but has limited information on unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Would you like me to expand those sections?"
```

## Target Users

1. **Knowledge Workers**: Professionals who manage large amounts of information and need to retrieve and organize it efficiently.

2. **Researchers**: Academics and researchers who maintain extensive notes on their subjects of study.

3. **Writers and Content Creators**: People who collect ideas, references, and drafts for creative projects.

4. **Personal Knowledge Managers**: Individuals who maintain detailed personal knowledge bases for learning and productivity.

5. **Obsidian Power Users**: Users already familiar with Obsidian who want to enhance their workflow with AI capabilities.

## Success Metrics

1. **Usage Frequency**: How often users interact with their vault through the AI assistant.

2. **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of user requests that are successfully fulfilled.

3. **Time Savings**: Reduction in time spent on knowledge management tasks.

4. **Vault Growth**: Increase in the size and organization of the user's knowledge base.

5. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback and continued usage of the plugin.
