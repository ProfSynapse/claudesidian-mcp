2. **MCP Server Improvements**
   - Enhancing resource and tool handling
   - Improving error handling and reporting
   - Optimizing server initialization and shutdown
   - Supporting cross-platform IPC mechanisms

3. **Tool Enhancements**
   - Consolidating tool functionality
   - Improving tool argument validation
   - Adding undo capabilities to tools
   - Enhancing search functionality

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Improving startup time
   - Optimizing vault operations
   - Enhancing search performance
   - Implementing caching where appropriate

## Recent Changes

### Architectural Improvements

     - `HttpClient`: Handles HTTP requests
     - `OpenRouterAdapter`: Handles OpenRouter API interactions

3. **Dependency Injection Implementation**
   - Created `ServiceProvider` class to manage dependencies
   - Implemented constructor injection for all services
   - Made dependencies explicit in class constructors

4. **Interface-Based Design**
   - Defined clear interfaces for all services:
     - `INoteService`, `IFolderService`, `IPathService`
     - `IVaultManager`, `IAIAdapter`, `IHttpClient`
     - `IToolRegistry`, `IToolContext`, `IConversationManager`

### Tool Consolidation

1. **ManageNoteTool**
   - Consolidated note operations into a single tool
   - Added support for multiple actions (create, read, edit, delete, search)
   - Improved argument validation and error handling
   - Added undo capabilities for operations

2. **CompletionTool**
   - Created new implementation with dependency injection
   - Improved error handling and response formatting
   - Added support for different AI models
   - Enhanced parameter validation

### Memory System Simplification

1. **Memory System Removal**
   - Removed complex memory system to focus on core functionality
   - Simplified conversation state tracking
   - Removed memory-specific folders and operations
   - Streamlined tool descriptions and workflows

## Next Steps

   - Document API for extension developers
   - Create examples for common use cases

4. **Bug Fixes**
   - Address initialization issues on some platforms
   - Fix path handling edge cases
   - Resolve tool execution errors
   - Improve error reporting

### Medium-term Goals

4. **MCP Protocol Updates**
   - Stay current with MCP specification changes
   - Implement new protocol features
   - Enhance resource handling
   - Improve client compatibility

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Service Provider Pattern**
   - **Decision**: Implement a central `ServiceProvider` class to manage dependencies
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies dependency management and service access
   - **Considerations**: Potential for service provider to become a god object if not carefully managed
   - **Status**: Implemented, working well

2. **Interface-Based Design**
   - **Decision**: Define interfaces for all services
   - **Rationale**: Improves testability and allows multiple implementations
   - **Considerations**: Adds some complexity but benefits outweigh costs
   - **Status**: Implemented for most services, some still need interfaces

3. **Facade Pattern for Backward Compatibility**
   - **Decision**: Create `VaultManagerFacade` to maintain backward compatibility
   - **Rationale**: Allows gradual migration without breaking existing code
   - **Considerations**: Temporary solution until all code is updated
   - **Status**: Implemented, working as expected

### Technical Considerations

1. **Type Casting Issues**
   - **Issue**: Some code uses concrete classes where interfaces are expected
   - **Current Approach**: Using `as any` type casting as a temporary solution
   - **Ideal Solution**: Update all code to use interfaces properly
   - **Status**: In progress, some type casting still needed

2. **Circular Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: Circular dependencies between interface files
   - **Current Approach**: Consolidated interfaces in `ToolInterfaces.ts`
   - **Considerations**: May need further refactoring for cleaner separation
   - **Status**: Partially resolved, some circular references remain

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across the codebase
   - **Current Approach**: Gradually improving error handling in each component
   - **Ideal Solution**: Comprehensive error handling strategy with proper logging
   - **Status**: In progress, needs more work

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - **Issue**: Limited test coverage
   - **Current Approach**: Planning to add tests for core services first
   - **Considerations**: Need to set up proper mocking for Obsidian API
   - **Status**: Planning phase, implementation pending

### Open Questions

1. **Mobile Support**
   - **Question**: How to handle MCP server on mobile platforms?
   - **Current Thinking**: May need alternative approach for mobile
   - **Options**: Simplified tool set, different communication mechanism
   - **Status**: Under investigation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Question**: Where are the performance bottlenecks?
   - **Current Thinking**: Search operations and initialization are likely candidates
   - **Options**: Caching, lazy loading, optimized search algorithms
   - **Status**: Need profiling to identify bottlenecks

3. **Tool API Design**
   - **Question**: How to make tools more consistent and user-friendly?
   - **Current Thinking**: Standardize argument patterns and response formats
   - **Options**: Schema-based validation, common response structure
   - **Status**: In progress, some standardization implemented

4. **Security Model**
   - **Question**: How to balance security and usability?
   - **Current Thinking**: Path restrictions with user-configurable allowed paths
   - **Options**: Granular permissions, approval for sensitive operations
   - **Status**: Basic implementation in place, needs enhancement
