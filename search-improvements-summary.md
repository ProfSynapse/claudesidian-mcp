# Search Improvements Summary

## Overview
We've successfully consolidated our search functionality into a single `SearchOperations` class, simplifying our architecture while enhancing search capabilities. This consolidation provides better access to advanced search features while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.

## Changes Made

### 1. SearchOperations Class
- Consolidated all search functionality into a single class (renamed from SearchUtil)
- Exported the `SearchWeights` interface to make it available for other components
- Maintained all existing functionality while exposing it directly to the tools

### 2. SearchContentTool
- Updated to use `SearchOperations` directly
- Enhanced the interface to support advanced search capabilities:
  - Added support for `includeMetadata` option
  - Added support for `searchFields` to specify which fields to search in
  - Added support for custom `weights` to adjust search scoring
  - Added support for `includeContent` option to include content in results
- Updated the schema to document the new options
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. SearchTagTool
- Updated to use `SearchOperations.searchByTag` directly
- Simplified the implementation
- Maintained the same return type for backward compatibility

### 4. SearchPropertyTool
- Updated to use `SearchOperations.searchByProperty` directly
- Simplified the implementation
- Maintained the same return type for backward compatibility

### 5. Types
- Enhanced `SearchContentArgs` interface to support the new options:
  - `includeMetadata`: Whether to include metadata in the search
  - `searchFields`: Fields to search in (title, content, tags, etc.)
  - `weights`: Custom weights for different search factors
  - `includeContent`: Whether to include content in the results

## Benefits

1. **Direct Access to Advanced Features**: Tools now have direct access to the advanced search capabilities provided by `SearchOperations`.

2. **Cleaner Architecture**: Consolidated search functionality into a single class, making the code more maintainable.

3. **Enhanced Search Options**: Users of the `SearchContentTool` now have more control over how searches are performed.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code.

5. **Improved Performance**: Direct access to `SearchUtil` may provide slight performance improvements by eliminating function call overhead.

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation to reflect the new search capabilities and consolidated architecture.
2. Add unit tests for the new search options to ensure they work as expected.

3. Consider adding more advanced search options in the future, such as:
   - Fuzzy search tolerance configuration
   - Boosting specific files or folders in search results
   - Search result caching for frequently used queries

4. Explore opportunities to further enhance the `SearchOperations` class with additional features while maintaining its clean, consolidated design.
