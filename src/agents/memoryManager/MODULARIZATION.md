# Memory Manager Modularization

This document describes the modularization of the MemoryManager class, breaking down the monolithic implementation into smaller, more maintainable utility classes.

## Overview

The original `memoryManager.ts` file was quite large with over 700 lines of code, containing all the logic for memory management in a single class. The refactoring breaks this down into specialized utility classes that each handle a specific aspect of memory management.

## Modular Structure

The refactored code is organized into the following utility classes:

### `DatabaseOperations`

Handles all interactions with the vector database:
- Deleting embeddings for files
- Cleaning up orphaned embeddings
- Updating database statistics
- Checking if files need reindexing
- Adding embeddings to the database

### `FilePathOperations`

Manages file path matching and filtering:
- Checking if a file is excluded based on patterns
- Matching file paths against glob patterns
- Identifying markdown files
- Finding eligible files for indexing

### `FileEventOperations`

Manages Obsidian file events:
- Registering file event listeners
- Handling file modifications
- Handling file deletions
- Handling file renames

### `IndexingOperations`

Handles all aspects of file indexing:
- Indexing individual files
- Chunking content
- Generating embeddings
- Batch processing for vault-wide indexing

### `QueryOperations`

Manages semantic search operations:
- Querying the database with embeddings
- Processing and enhancing query results
- Applying filters and thresholds

### `UsageStatsOperations`

Manages statistics and usage tracking:
- Saving usage statistics to localStorage
- Loading usage statistics
- Resetting counters
- Updating token usage
- Creating usage snapshots for reporting

## Benefits of Modularization

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each utility class has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.

2. **Better Testability**: Smaller units can be tested independently with clearer boundaries.

3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Utility classes can be reused across different parts of the application.

4. **Reduced Complexity**: The main MemoryManager class is now simpler and delegates specific operations to utility classes.

5. **Clearer Dependencies**: Dependencies between different aspects of memory management are more explicit.

## Implementation

The original code has been preserved in `memoryManager.ts`, and a refactored version has been created as `memoryManager-refactored.ts`. To adopt the refactored version:

1. Review the refactored implementation
2. Ensure all functionality works as expected
3. Replace the original file with the refactored version
4. Update imports in other files if necessary

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding proper unit tests for each utility class
- Explore further modularization, especially for provider management
- Implement proper error handling and recovery strategies
- Add telemetry and performance monitoring
