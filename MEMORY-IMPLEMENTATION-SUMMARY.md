# Memory Manager Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the new MemoryManager agent, which replaces the session and snapshot functionality previously found in the ProjectManager agent.

## Overview

The MemoryManager agent provides dedicated functionality for managing workspace memory through sessions and states (formerly snapshots). It follows the standard agent-mode architecture with a comprehensive set of modes for creating, listing, editing, and deleting both sessions and states.

## Key Components

### MemoryManagerAgent

Located at `/src/agents/memoryManager/memoryManager.ts`, this agent:
- Registers all session and state modes
- Provides utilities for accessing the activity embedder and workspace database
- Handles automatic session context tracking
- Creates sessions automatically when needed

### Types

Located at `/src/agents/memoryManager/types.ts`, this file defines:
- Comprehensive parameter and result types for all session and state operations
- Consistent naming conventions (state instead of snapshot)
- Rich context options for both sessions and states

### Session Modes

1. **CreateSessionMode**
   - Creates a new session with rich context
   - Associates with a workspace
   - Adds metadata including name, description, goal, and tags

2. **ListSessionsMode**
   - Lists sessions with flexible filtering options
   - Supports filtering by workspace, tags, and metadata
   - Includes options for sorting and pagination

3. **EditSessionMode**
   - Updates session properties including name, description, and tags
   - Records changes for context continuity
   - Maintains session timeline integrity

4. **DeleteSessionMode**
   - Removes sessions with options for associated data
   - Includes safety checks and considerations for linked states
   - Provides graceful handling of dependent resources

### State Modes

1. **CreateStateMode**
   - Creates workspace state snapshots with rich context
   - Captures relevant files, metadata, and session information
   - Generates comprehensive summaries for better context

2. **ListStatesMode**
   - Lists states with flexible filtering
   - Supports filtering by workspace, session, and metadata
   - Includes context for rich browsing

3. **LoadStateMode**
   - Restores workspace state with comprehensive context
   - Creates continuation sessions if requested
   - Maintains timeline of state changes

4. **EditStateMode**
   - Updates state properties including name, description, and tags
   - Records changes for context continuity
   - Maintains state timeline integrity

5. **DeleteStateMode**
   - Removes states with proper cleanup
   - Records deletion in memory traces
   - Provides details about the deleted state

## Terminology Changes

- "Snapshot" → "State" throughout the codebase
- "RestoreSnapshot" → "LoadState" for better conceptual clarity

## Integration

The MemoryManager agent is fully integrated into the plugin architecture:
- Registered in the connector.ts file
- Accessible through the main plugin class
- Properly connected to the activity embedder and workspace database

## Changes to ProjectManager

The session and snapshot modes have been removed from the ProjectManager agent:
- Removed from mode registrations in projectManager.ts
- Removed from exports in projectManager/modes/index.ts
- Files are still present for reference but no longer registered or active

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all memory management operations
2. **Documentation**: Update user-facing documentation to reflect the new terminology and capabilities
3. **UI Integration**: Ensure the memory management features are properly exposed in the UI
4. **Migration**: Consider adding migration functionality for existing workspaces

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Memory management is now a dedicated responsibility
2. **Improved Terminology**: "State" is more intuitive than "Snapshot"
3. **Enhanced Context**: Both sessions and states now provide richer context
4. **Consistent API**: Comprehensive and consistent API for all memory operations
5. **Better Integration**: Tighter integration with the activity embedder for rich context
