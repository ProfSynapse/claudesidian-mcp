1. **Search Initiation Banner**: Clear indication when full content retrieval search starts
2. **Content Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of full vs snippet results
3. **Individual Result Inspection**: First 3 results analyzed for content type and truncation
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Complete timing analysis including payload size impact
5. **Validation Checks**: Automated verification of key success criteria
6. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging with timing information

### 📊 Expected Diagnostic Output

When the plugin runs searches, you should see output like this:

### 🎯 Key Validation Points

#### ✅ Full Content Delivery
- **Check**: Search results return complete embedded chunks instead of truncated snippets
- **Evidence**: `contentType: 'FULL'` in individual result analysis
- **Success Indicator**: `hasFullContent: true` for majority of results

#### ✅ No More Truncation
- **Check**: No results show ellipsis truncation ("...ng a topic")  
- **Evidence**: `wasTruncated: 'NO'` in individual result analysis
- **Success Indicator**: `No Truncated Snippets: YES` in validation checks

#### ✅ Performance Acceptable  
- **Check**: 4.7x-8.9x payload increase with reasonable response times
- **Evidence**: `Payload Increase Factor: 6.2x` in content analysis
- **Success Indicator**: Response times under 100ms for typical queries

#### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- **Check**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Evidence**: Fallback to snippets when full content unavailable
- **Success Indicator**: `snippet: result.content || result.snippet || result.preview || ''`
