## Conclusion

The codebase shows typical evolution patterns of a growing application where features have been added incrementally without periodic refactoring. The identified violations are not critical bugs but represent technical debt that will increase maintenance costs over time. A systematic refactoring approach focusing on the highest-severity files first will yield the best return on investment.
