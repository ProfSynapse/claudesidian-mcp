### Workspaces

- Each workspace has its own sessions and memory traces
- Store workspaces in `.workspaces/` at vault root
- Default workspace created automatically
- Switch workspaces from chat interface

## Architecture

Nexus uses an **Agent-Mode Architecture**:

- **Agents**: Logical domains (ContentManager, VaultManager, etc.)
- **Modes**: Specific operations within each agent
- **Services**: Shared functionality (WorkspaceService, MemoryService, etc.)
- **Chat Interface**: User-facing AI assistant powered by agents

This architecture ensures:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent interfaces
- Type safety
- Easy testing and maintenance
