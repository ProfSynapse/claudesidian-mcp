# üîç **Debugging Console Logs for Migration Testing**

## **Console Log Categories for Obsidian Testing**

When testing the data migration in Obsidian, look for these specific console log patterns to track what's happening:

### **üöÄ Plugin Load Sequence**
```
[Claudesidian] Loading Claudesidian MCP Plugin
[Claudesidian] DataMigrationService initialized with new architecture
[Claudesidian] ========== MIGRATION CHECK START ==========
```

### **üìä Migration Status Detection**
```
[Claudesidian] Checking migration status...
[Claudesidian] Data directory exists: /path/to/.data
[Claudesidian] Loading all ChromaDB collections...
[Claudesidian] Reading ChromaDB collection: memory_traces from /path/to/collections/memory_traces/items.json
[Claudesidian] Read ChromaDB collection: memory_traces (X items)
[Claudesidian] Collection counts: {memoryTraces: X, sessions: Y, conversations: Z, ...}
```

### **‚úÖ Migration Required Path**
```
[Claudesidian] Migration status result: {isRequired: true, hasLegacyData: true, ...}
[Claudesidian] ========== STARTING MIGRATION ==========
[Claudesidian] Starting migration to new JSON architecture...
[Claudesidian] Created data directory: /path/to/.data
[Claudesidian] Starting transformation to new structure...
[Claudesidian] Transforming conversations...
[Claudesidian] Transforming workspace hierarchy...
[Claudesidian] Building workspace search index...
[Claudesidian] Building conversation search index...
[Claudesidian] Wrote JSON file: workspace-data.json (X chars)
[Claudesidian] Wrote JSON file: conversations.json (Y chars)
[Claudesidian] Wrote JSON file: workspace-index.json (Z chars)
[Claudesidian] Wrote JSON file: conversations-index.json (A chars)
[Claudesidian] ========== MIGRATION RESULT ==========
[Claudesidian] Migration result: {success: true, workspaces: X, sessions: Y, ...}
[Claudesidian] ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Migration completed successfully!
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è No Migration Needed Path**
```
[Claudesidian] Migration status result: {isRequired: false, migrationComplete: true}
[Claudesidian] ‚úÖ Migration already completed - skipping
```

### **‚ùå Error Paths to Watch For**

**File Reading Errors**:
```
[Claudesidian] Could not read ChromaDB collection: memory_traces [Error details]
[Claudesidian] Attempted path: /full/path/to/items.json
```

**Migration Errors**:
```
[Claudesidian] ‚ùå MIGRATION FAILED
[Claudesidian] Errors: [Array of error messages]
[Claudesidian] Migration failed: [Specific error]
```

**Service Errors**:
```
[Claudesidian] Error loading workspaces: [Error details]
[Claudesidian] Error in getAllTraces: [Error details]
[Claudesidian] Error loading conversations: [Error details]
```

### **üéØ Key Success Indicators**

1. **Migration Detection**: Look for collection counts > 0
   ```
   [Claudesidian] Collection counts: {memoryTraces: 15, sessions: 51, conversations: 1, ...}
   ```

2. **Data Transformation**: Check for transformation completion
   ```
   [Claudesidian] Transformation completed
   ```

3. **File Creation**: Verify JSON files are written
   ```
   [Claudesidian] Wrote JSON file: workspace-data.json (12543 chars)
   [Claudesidian] Wrote JSON file: conversations.json (8921 chars)
   ```

4. **Final Success**: Look for success message
   ```
   [Claudesidian] ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Migration completed successfully! Workspaces: 5, Sessions: 51, ...
   ```

### **üîß Service Operation Logs**

**WorkspaceService**:
```
[Claudesidian] Loading all workspaces...
[Claudesidian] Loaded X workspaces
```

**MemoryService**:
```
[Claudesidian] Loading workspace data...
[Claudesidian] Getting memory traces for workspace: [workspace-id]
```

**ConversationService**:
```
[Claudesidian] Loading conversation data...
[Claudesidian] Loaded X conversations
```

### **üìÅ File Paths to Check**

**New Data Files** (should be created):
- `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/.data/workspace-data.json`
- `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/.data/conversations.json`
- `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/.data/workspace-index.json`
- `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/.data/conversations-index.json`

**Legacy ChromaDB Files** (source data):
- `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/data/chroma-db/collections/memory_traces/items.json`
- `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/data/chroma-db/collections/sessions/items.json`
- `.obsidian/plugins/claudesidian-mcp/data/chroma-db/collections/chat_conversations/items.json`

### **üêõ Common Issues to Watch For**

1. **Path Issues**: Check if file paths are correct for your OS
2. **Permission Issues**: Look for file write/read permission errors
3. **JSON Parsing**: Check for malformed JSON in ChromaDB files
4. **Empty Collections**: Verify ChromaDB collections have data
5. **Type Errors**: Watch for TypeScript interface mismatches

### **üí° Debugging Tips**

1. **Open Obsidian Developer Console**: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
2. **Filter Console**: Type `[Claudesidian]` to filter all relevant logs
3. **Check Notice Messages**: Look for Obsidian notices in the UI
4. **Verify File Creation**: Check if `.data/` directory and JSON files are created
5. **Test Service Operations**: Try using workspace/memory operations to verify data access

## **Expected Migration Timeline**

- **Startup Detection**: 100-500ms
- **ChromaDB Reading**: 500-2000ms (depending on data size)
- **Data Transformation**: 200-1000ms
- **File Writing**: 100-500ms
- **Total Migration**: Usually 1-4 seconds for typical datasets
