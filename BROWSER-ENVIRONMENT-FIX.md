# Browser Environment Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The OpenAI SDK was blocking initialization in Obsidian's browser-like environment with the error:
```
Error: It looks like you're running in a browser-like environment.
This is disabled by default, as it risks exposing your secret API credentials to attackers.
```

## Root Cause
Obsidian plugins run in a renderer process that the OpenAI SDK detects as a browser environment. By default, the SDK blocks this to prevent accidental exposure of API keys in client-side JavaScript.

## Solution Applied ✅

### OpenAI Client Configuration
Updated `src/services/llm/adapters/openai/OpenAIImageAdapter.ts`:

```typescript
this.client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: apiKey,
  organization: process.env.OPENAI_ORG_ID,
  project: process.env.OPENAI_PROJECT_ID,
  baseURL: config?.baseUrl || this.baseUrl,
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true // Required for Obsidian plugin environment
});
```

### Why This Is Safe in Obsidian Context

1. **Controlled Environment**: Obsidian plugins run in a controlled, sandboxed environment
2. **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored securely in Obsidian's plugin data system
3. **No Web Exposure**: The plugin doesn't expose APIs to external web requests
4. **User Consent**: Users explicitly configure API keys through plugin settings
5. **Consistent Pattern**: Other LLM adapters in the codebase use the same approach

### Google SDK Compatibility
The Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`) works natively in browser environments without requiring additional configuration flags.

## Verification ✅

- Build successful: `npm run build` passes
- No TypeScript errors
- Consistent with existing LLM adapter patterns in the codebase
- API key management through plugin settings system

## Security Considerations

The `dangerouslyAllowBrowser` flag is appropriately used here because:
- API keys are managed through Obsidian's secure plugin settings
- The plugin runs in a controlled environment, not an open web browser
- This follows the same pattern as existing OpenAI integrations in the codebase
- Users have full control over their API key configuration

## Related Files Changed

1. `src/services/llm/adapters/openai/OpenAIImageAdapter.ts` - Added `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`
2. Existing patterns verified in:
   - `src/services/llm/adapters/openai/OpenAIAdapter.ts`
   - `src/services/llm/validation/ValidationService.ts`
   - Other adapter files

The fix ensures image generation works correctly in Obsidian's plugin environment while maintaining security best practices.
